LLM Finetuning: Enabling Quality Embedding and Text Generation for Amharic, Swahili, and Yoruba Languages

## Project Overview
Business Need
AfroTech Solutions is an innovative African company that focuses on using AI to improve customer support and engagement. Our goal is to help African businesses by using new technology in AI. Our latest project is an AI-powered customer support system designed for the African market. By using advanced AI, this system aims to provide smooth, multilingual support across different platforms.
This project aims to make our customer support services better by using AI to generate text in Amharic, Swahili, and Yoruba. We plan to create systems that can generate quick and relevant responses in these languages based on customer questions and past interactions.
For this project to be successful, our customer support must be both efficient and meaningful to our diverse clients. To achieve this, the technology needs to have strong capabilities in text embedding and generation for Amharic, Swahili, and Yoruba. We will collect large datasets for each language and fine-tune suitable open-source LLM models based on the datasets collected in the previous week. For Amharic, we may use models like Nous Hermes Mistral 8 7B or amharic language finetuned version of  LLama 2 (Samuael/llama-2-7b-tebot-amharic or iocuydi/llama-2-amharic-3784m) -  and finetune it further to deliver the business objective. We will also select and fine-tune equivalent models for Swahili and Yoruba based on the collected data and the chosen language in the previous week to meet our business goals effectively.

## Inspirations 
The following works are our inspiration. We envision to collaborate with all stakeholders to create a robust quality LLM for the languages.
